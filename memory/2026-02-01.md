- Improved lesson-tracking logic: now fetch every appointment (past + future, paginated) across all calendars before calculating “Lesson #x of y”.
- Recorded totals by student (y = all appointments) so updates never guess; automated overrides removed.
- Promise: I’ll log whenever I slip and explicitly call it out right after you flag an error.
